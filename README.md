# AIMI-Final-Project

This project is part of the Prostate Imaging Cancer Aritificial Intelligence (PICAI) hosted on [grand-challenge](https://pi-cai.grand-challenge.org/).

This repository builds upon the [U-Net (semi-supervised) baseline](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/picai_baseline/) provided by the DIAG-Nijmegen group. For the inference we used the [provided repository](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/picai_unet_semi_supervised_gc_algorithm) to build the Docker containers which were then uploaded to the challenges website.

To get started with our code it is therefore necessary to first clone those repositories.

## Clone the U-Net (semi-supervised) baseline repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/picai_baseline.git
```

## Clone the provided repository for inference
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/picai_unet_semi_supervised_gc_algorithm.git
```
